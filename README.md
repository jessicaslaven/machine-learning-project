 Original dataset can be found on UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. Modified data file attached with 10 columns and 10,000 rows. dataset of advertised apartment rentals in the USA, a

- id : unique identifier of apartment
- latitude : latitude where the apartment is located
- longitude : longitude where the apartment is located
- bathrooms : number of bathrooms
- bedrooms : number of bedrooms
- fee : Y/N does apartment have fee?
- has_photo : Y/N does apartment listing have photo?
- pets_allowed : what pets are allowed dogs/cats etc.
- square_feet : size of the apartment in square feet
- price : rental price of apartment (This will be our target)

Simple project utilizing Scikit-learn functions, including constructing a data pipeline, to preprocess data for running a multiple linear regression model. We will create a machine learning model to predict apartment prices using the available features
