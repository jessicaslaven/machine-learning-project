# machine-learning-project

Project Overview:
This is a beginner-level data science project that walks through:   
-Loading Data   
-Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration  
-Constructing a data pipeline  
-Building and running a Multiple Linear Regression Model  

The goal is to create a model that will predict apartment prices using the feature information available to us.  

The original dataset can be found on UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. A modified version of the data file (attached) containing 10 columns and 10,000 rows was used for this project. 

- id : unique identifier of apartment
- latitude : latitude where the apartment is located
- longitude : longitude where the apartment is located
- bathrooms : number of bathrooms
- bedrooms : number of bedrooms
- fee : Y/N does apartment have fee?
- has_photo : Y/N does apartment listing have photo?
- pets_allowed : what pets are allowed dogs/cats etc.
- square_feet : size of the apartment in square feet
- price : rental price of apartment (This will be our target)
