# machine-learning-project

📂 Project Overview:
This is a beginner-level data science project that walks through:   
-Loading Data   
-Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploration  
-Constructing a data pipeline  
-Building and running a Multiple Linear Regression Model  

The goal is to create a model that will predict apartment prices using the feature information available to us.  

📝 Skills used:  
-Data analysis using Pandas  
-Data Visualization  
-Machine Learning using Scikit-Learn  

📋 The original dataset can be found on UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. A modified version of the data file (attached) containing 10 columns and 10,000 rows was used for this project. 

Columns:  
- id (unique identifier of apartment)
- latitude  
- longitude  
- bathrooms  
- bedrooms  
- fee (Y/N - does apartment have fee?)  
- has_photo (Y/N - does the listing contain a photo?)  
- pets_allowed (what pets are allowed - dogs, cats, etc.)  
- square_feet  
- price
